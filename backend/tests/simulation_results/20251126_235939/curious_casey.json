Dermal fillers add volume to soften deeper lines and can last 6 months or more. Botox typically ranges from $300 to $600 per session, while fillers usually start around $600 depending on the amount needed. Would you like details on preparation or aftercare for either?"

Fillers add volume to plump and soften wrinkles. \n\nBotox typically costs between $300-$600 per session, and fillers range from $600-$1,200 depending on the amount used.\n\nFor preparation, avoid alcohol and blood thinners 24 hours before Botox or fillers to reduce bruising. Aftercare includes avoiding heavy exercise, heat, and touching the treated area for 24 hours.\n\nOur consultations are complimentary, so there's no fee to meet with a provider and discuss your goals before booking any treatment. Would you like to schedule a consultation?"
