Also, try to avoid strenuous exercise, lying down, or heavy sun exposure for the rest of the day. If you'd like, I can share more detailed aftercare tips. Would you like that?"

To help reduce it, try applying a cold compress gently for 10-15 minutes at a time during the first day. Avoid heavy exercise, alcohol, and lying down flat for about 4 hours after treatment.
